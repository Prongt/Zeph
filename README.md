# S.D.A.T (Super Duper Awesome Team)
## Intro

## Coding Standards
###### Classes, Structs & Interfaces
All declarations of classes and structs use PascalCase eg PlayerMove.

Interfaces should use PascalCase prefixed with an I eg IPlayerMove.

###### Methods
Methods use PascalCase and should be private where possible.

###### Fields/Variables
Public variables use PascalCase.

Private variables use camelCase.

Static variables will be prefixed with an underscore.

**Public variables should be made private and use the [SerializeField] attribute where ever possible.**


**All variables that are accessible from the editor should use the [Tooltip("")] attribute and have an appropriate description.**
